#1. Install Required Libraries
#pip install opencv-python
#pip install torch torchvision
#pip install ultralytics  # For YOLO11++
#pip install pyttsx3  # Text-to-Speech library
#pip install numpy
#pip install openai  # For GPT-3/4 (Large Language Model)
#pip install threading # Used for parallel collective run
#pip install sklearn  # For the Perceptron



#2. Import Libraries

import cv2
import torch
import numpy as np
import pyttsx3
import openai
from sklearn.neural_network import Perceptron
from ultralytics import YOLO
import threading

#3. Initialize OpenAI, YOLO, and TTS

#You need to load YOLO11++ for object detection and initialize text-to-speech (TTS) for audio feedback. You can also initialize a perceptron to dynamically update facts.

# Initialize OpenAI API for decision-making (if needed)
openai.api_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"  # Make sure to replace with your API key

# Load YOLO model (YOLO11++)
model = YOLO("yolo11++.pt")  

# Initialize pyttsx3 for Text-to-Speech (audio feedback)
engine = pyttsx3.init()

def speak(text):
    engine.say(text)
    engine.runAndWait()

# Perceptron for dynamic facts update
perceptron = Perceptron(max_iter=1000)

# Initialize an empty list for facts (e.g., detected objects, vehicle status)
facts = []

# Initialize rules (based on detections and system learning)
rules = {
    "pedestrian_detected": "slow_down",
    "vehicle_detected": "maintain_distance",
    "stop_sign_detected": "stop",
    # More rules can be added dynamically
}

#4. Detect Objects with YOLO

#The function detect_objects will process frames from the camera and identify objects like pedestrians, vehicles, etc.

def detect_objects(frame):
    results = model(frame)  # Perform object detection using YOLO
    detections = results.pandas().xywh[0]  # Convert results to Pandas DataFrame
    return detections

#5. Update Facts Using Perceptron

#The perceptron will be used to update facts dynamically, based on detected objects. We can train the perceptron to associate object types with certain driving facts (like stopping, slowing down, etc.).

def update_facts(detections):
    global facts

    new_facts = []

    # Extract facts based on the detections
    for _, row in detections.iterrows():
        label = row['name']
        confidence = row['confidence']

        # Update the facts list based on detected objects
        if label == 'person' and confidence > 0.5:
            new_facts.append('pedestrian_detected')
        elif label == 'car' and confidence > 0.5:
            new_facts.append('vehicle_detected')
        elif label == 'stop sign' and confidence > 0.5:
            new_facts.append('stop_sign_detected')

    # Update perceptron with new facts
    if new_facts:
        fact_vector = [1 if fact in new_facts else 0 for fact in rules.keys()]
        perceptron.partial_fit([fact_vector], [1])  # Simulate learning a correct action

    facts.extend(new_facts)

#6. Evaluate Decisions and Update Rules

#After making a decision based on detected objects, we can evaluate the decision outcome (e.g., did the vehicle stop when it should have?) and update the rules accordingly. For this purpose, we could use a simple feedback mechanism to improve the system over time.

def evaluate_and_update_rules(action_taken):
    # Example rule-based decision evaluation (you can make it more sophisticated)
    if action_taken == "stop":
        print("Evaluating stop decision...")
        # If the vehicle did not stop appropriately, adjust the rule
        if "pedestrian_detected" in facts:
            print("Pedestrian detected, updating rule to stop more effectively.")
            rules["pedestrian_detected"] = "stop"

#7. Decision Making with LLM (Optional)

#Optionally, you can use a Large Language Model (like GPT-4) to process complex scenarios and update rules based on the context.

def get_llm_decision(objects_detected):
    # Create a prompt for LLM (e.g., GPT-4) based on detected objects
    object_labels = [obj['name'] for _, obj in objects_detected.iterrows()]
    prompt = f"Given the detected objects: {', '.join(object_labels)}, what should the autonomous vehicle do?"

    # Query the LLM for decision-making
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        model="text-davinci-003",  # Use GPT-4 if needed
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=150,
        temperature=0.7
    )

    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

#8. Combine the Components and Provide Audio Feedback

#The system continuously processes frames, updates facts, evaluates decisions, and provides audio feedback.

def process_frame():
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # Open webcam (you can replace with a video file if needed)

    if not cap.isOpened():
        print("Error: Could not open video stream.")
        exit()

    while True:
        ret, frame = cap.read()
        if not ret:
            print("Failed to grab frame")
            break

        # Step 1: Detect objects in the frame using YOLO
        detections = detect_objects(frame)

        # Step 2: Update facts using the perceptron (learn from environment)
        update_facts(detections)

        # Step 3: Get decision based on facts and objects detected
        decision = get_llm_decision(detections)

        # Step 4: Provide audio feedback for the decision
        speak(decision)

        # Step 5: Visualize detections with bounding boxes
        frame_with_boxes = frame.copy()
        for _, row in detections.iterrows():
            x1, y1, x2, y2 = int(row['xmin']), int(row['ymin']), int(row['xmax']), int(row['ymax'])
            label = row['name']
            confidence = row['confidence']
            cv2.rectangle(frame_with_boxes, (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (0, 255, 0), 2)
            cv2.putText(frame_with_boxes, f"{label} {confidence:.2f}", (x1, y1 - 10),
                        cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 0.6, (255, 255, 255), 2)

        # Step 6: Display the frame with detections
        cv2.imshow("Object Detection", frame_with_boxes)

        if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
            break

    cap.release()
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()

#9. Running the System

#We run the system, which will continuously process frames, detect objects, evaluate decisions, update facts and rules, and provide real-time audio feedback.

def run_system():
    detection_thread = threading.Thread(target=process_frame)
    detection_thread.start()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_system()

#Final Thoughts:

    #Real-time Performance: The system uses a multi-threaded approach for parallel collective run to ensure optimal real-time processing for object detection, decision-making, and audio feedback.
    #Learning and Adaptation: The perceptron dynamically updates facts based on the detected objects. As the system receives more feedback and detects more scenarios, it can adjust its rules and behaviors.
    #Extendability: This setup can be further extended by introducing more complex rules, including reinforcement learning to optimize the vehicleâ€™s decisions over time, and using advanced LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) for more nuanced decision-making.
    
#This architecture forms the foundation of a UAES for autonomous driving that adapts to its environment, learns from experience, and provides audio feedback to the driver or system operator.

#Safety: Ensure that safety checks are in place before implementing this system in a real-world autonomous vehicle.
