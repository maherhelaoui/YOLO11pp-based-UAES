#1. Install Required Libraries
#pip install opencv-python
#pip install torch torchvision
#pip install ultralytics  # For YOLO11++
#pip install pyttsx3  # Text-to-Speech library
#pip install numpy
#pip install openai  # For GPT-3/4 (Large Language Model)
#pip install threading # Used for parallel collective run


#2. Import Necessary Libraries:

import cv2
import torch
import numpy as np
import pyttsx3
import openai
from ultralytics import YOLO
import threading

#3. Initialize OpenAI and YOLO Model:

#We will use OpenAI GPT-3/4 for decision-making and our proposed YOLO11++ for real-time object detection. Ensure you have a valid OpenAI API key for GPT.

# Initialize OpenAI API (ensure you have set up an OpenAI API key)
openai.api_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"

# Load YOLO11++ Model
model = YOLO("yolo11++.pt")  

#4. Initialize Text-to-Speech (TTS):

#Using pyttsx3, we can give audio feedback for the recommendations.

# Initialize pyttsx3 for Text-to-Speech
engine = pyttsx3.init()

def speak(text):
    engine.say(text)
    engine.runAndWait()

#5. Define Functions for YOLO and LLM Interaction:

    #Object Detection with YOLO: Detect objects in the video feed.
    #Decision-Making with LLM: Ask GPT-based LLM for advice based on the detected objects and conditions.

def detect_objects(frame):
    results = model(frame)  # Perform object detection using YOLO
    detections = results.pandas().xywh[0]  # Convert results to Pandas DataFrame
    return detections

def get_llm_decision(objects_detected):
    # Create a prompt for the LLM (e.g., GPT-4) based on detected objects
    object_labels = [obj['name'] for _, obj in objects_detected.iterrows()]
    prompt = f"Given the detected objects: {', '.join(object_labels)}, what should the autonomous vehicle do?"

    # Query the LLM for decision-making
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        model="text-davinci-003",  # Or GPT-4 model if available
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=150,
        temperature=0.7
    )

    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

#6. Audio Recommendations Based on LLM:

#Using the LLM's response, we'll provide audio feedback.

def audio_feedback(decision):
    speak(decision)

#7. Real-time Processing Loop with Video Feed and Dynamic Decisions:

#Now we can combine the real-time video processing, object detection, and decision-making into a continuous loop that runs while capturing the video feed.

def process_frame():
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # Open webcam (use video file path if needed)
    
    if not cap.isOpened():
        print("Error: Could not open video stream.")
        exit()

    while True:
        ret, frame = cap.read()
        if not ret:
            print("Failed to grab frame")
            break
        
        # Step 1: Detect objects in the frame using YOLO
        detections = detect_objects(frame)

        # Step 2: Get decision from LLM based on detected objects
        decision = get_llm_decision(detections)

        # Step 3: Provide audio feedback based on LLM's decision
        audio_feedback(decision)

        # Step 4: Visualize bounding boxes and labels in the frame
        frame_with_boxes = frame.copy()
        for _, row in detections.iterrows():
            x1, y1, x2, y2 = int(row['xmin']), int(row['ymin']), int(row['xmax']), int(row['ymax'])
            label = row['name']
            confidence = row['confidence']
            cv2.rectangle(frame_with_boxes, (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (0, 255, 0), 2)
            cv2.putText(frame_with_boxes, f"{label} {confidence:.2f}", (x1, y1 - 10),
                        cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 0.6, (255, 255, 255), 2)

        # Step 5: Display the video feed with bounding boxes
        cv2.imshow("Object Detection", frame_with_boxes)

        if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):  # Press 'q' to exit
            break

    cap.release()
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()

#8. Running the System with Parallel Threads:

#To ensure real-time responsiveness, we can run object detection, decision-making, and audio feedback concurrently. We use Python's threading module to run the system smoothly.

def run_system():
    # Create and start the processing thread
    detection_thread = threading.Thread(target=process_frame)
    detection_thread.start()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_system()

#9. Explanation:

    #YOLO11++ (Object Detection): The system captures frames from the video stream and processes each frame to detect objects (e.g., pedestrians, cars, traffic lights).
    #LLM (Decision-Making): Based on the objects detected (e.g., "person", "car", "stop sign"), a prompt is created for the Large Language Model (LLM) (GPT-4). The LLM analyzes the context and suggests an appropriate course of action (e.g., "Stop the car", "Slow down", "Maintain speed").
    #Audio Feedback: The LLM's decision is converted into a verbal recommendation using text-to-speech (TTS), so the system can give real-time spoken advice or instructions.
    #Parallel Processing: Object detection, decision-making, and audio feedback are processed in parallel using threads for seamless real-time performance.

#Final Thoughts:

    #Real-time Processing: The system uses a threaded loop to ensure all components (video feed, detection, decision-making, and audio feedback) run concurrently and in real-time.
    #Extensibility: You can extend the LLM's capabilities by fine-tuning it or using more complex decision trees to handle a broader range of driving scenarios (e.g., weather conditions, road signs, and more).
    #Optimization: Depending on your hardware (especially GPU availability), you may need to optimize YOLO model inference speed to ensure the system can keep up with real-time video feeds.

#This combination of YOLO object detection, LLMs for decision-making, and audio recommendations creates a sophisticated and dynamic expert system for autonomous driving, which adapts to its environment and provides verbal feedback based on detected objects.
